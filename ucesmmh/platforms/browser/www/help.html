                <li><a href="#close">Load the Closeset Five Questions</a></li>
                <li><a href="#rank">Get My Ranking</a></li>

    <p>This display loads automatically once you start the application and it loads on all the questions added by you in the questions app. You can also access the default display through the <b>Load My Questions </b> option from the menu on the left-hand side. Once the questions load if there's any question within a distance of a 100 meters it will automatically display the question text and give you the chance to answer it as displayed in the screenshot below.</p><br><img src="images/def.jpg" alt="default_display" style="width:80%"><br><hr><p><i><b>Please note:</b> that you can close the popup without answering the question. Also you can choose <b>any question point displayed on the map</b> to answer the question related to it if you wish. You can do that by simply clicking on the point itself and the pop up will show holding the question details. It is also important to notice that once you answer any of the questions a message will display to inform you whether your answer is correct or not. You will also be informed about <b>your current count of correct answers</b> and you will be given <b>the correct answer</b> if your answer was not correct. Once you dismiss this message the colour of the question point will change to either <font color="red">red</font> or <font color="green">green</font> based on if your answer was correct or not.</i></p><p style="text-align: right"><a href="#help_top">Back to top</a></p><hr>
